## About Me

My name is Riddhi Sharma (Meta-Wiki username: [Herdaisymione](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Herdaisymione)).

I started my academic journey in the **science stream (PCM)** and later transitioned to the **arts/humanities stream**. While my formal studies shifted, my curiosity and involvement in **technical fields** never diminished. I am self-motivated, a fast learner, and dedicated to developing my skills through active contribution to open knowledge platforms and collaborative projects.

I believe that changing academic streams should not limit one's ambitions. I treat this interdisciplinary background as a strength and continue to invest time in learning and improving technical skills.

## Technical Work and Scripts

### Custom MediaWiki User Script
**Script**: `global-langbox.js`  
**Purpose**: Enhances the user interface by showing **language buttons** on Wikimedia pages based on the user's `#babel` template on Meta-Wiki.  
**Features**:
- Reads user language preferences from Meta-Wiki
- Displays links to other language versions using Wikidata sitelinks
- Automatically hides language button for the current wiki
- Designed to improve multilingual accessibility for active editors

The script reflects my commitment to usability, accessibility, and improving the multilingual experience across Wikimedia projects.

### Tool Ideas and Experiments
- Image renaming tool with AI captioning and geolocation tagging
- SPARQL-powered data explorers for tree species and image metadata
- Interest in developing browser extensions and Python-based tools for Wikimedia
